## Welcome to the Glitter docs!

The docs for glitter. Keep on reading if you are interested!

To use a flag, ie `-d`  you do something like this:
```sh
$ glitter -d -- ...
```
where ... is the rest of your command. The -- just signals you are done using flags and can start using the actual action / command.

### GlitterRc structure

The main structure of the file:

If it is suffixed with a ? that means it is optional.

```
commit_message?: String: The commit message template, use $<arg-idx> to get a specific arg and suffix with a + for a rest argument.
commit_message_arguments?: Arguments[]: The array of commit message arguments.
fetch?: Bool: Execute git fetch in commands.
custom_tasks?: CustomTaskOptions[]: Custom tasks specified which can be executed via the cc command.
hooks?: String[]: Things to run before `git commit`. You specify the name of a custom task defined in `custom_tasks`. The whole process will be aborted if the command returns exit status of 1
verbose?: Bool: Defaults to false. This just gives the outputs of commands. The CLI flag takes priority over this value.
```

Structures referenced:
